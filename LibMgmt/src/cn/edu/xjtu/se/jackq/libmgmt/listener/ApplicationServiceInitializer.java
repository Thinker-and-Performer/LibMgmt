Quincy Jones, Diane Keaton, Gloria Steinem, Julia Roberts, John Cleese and David Bowie are just a few of his celebrity alumni.Writers, producers, development executives and agents all flock to his lecture series, praising it as a mesmerizing and intense learning experience.

No one better understands how all the elements of a screenplay fit together, and no one is better qualified to explain the \"magic\" of story construction and the relationship between structure and character than Robert McKee.", 3);

Today's digital cameras are more affordable then ever before, and they deliver high quality images that are a snap to share. Plus, you can take risks with a digital camera you never would with a film camera. You waste nothing; there's no film required, and because you only print the pictures you need, digital photography is cost effective and environmentally friendly.   \n\n  But to take full advantage of a digital camera, you need to be an experienced photographer and an expert at digital photography too. With more than 15 years of experience as a photojournalist, author Derrick Story brings you Digital Photography Pocket Guide, 3rd Edition. For everyone who owns or will own a digital camera (and that pretty much means everyone!), this is the perfect on-the-go guide for taking top-notch digital photos.</p>  \n\n  In this third edition of the bestselling pocket guide, Story expands on the basic photography techniques that he introduced in earlier editions, including an explanation of each camera component and what it does, tips for choosing just the right settings for your needs, and much more. This indispensable guide covers everything from how to shoot sports action, close ups, and night shots, to dealing with image resolution, archiving, and memory cards.</p>  \n\n  Affordable and portable, Digital Photography Pocket Guide, 3rd Edition offers full-color photographs, screen shots, and line art illustrating all the topics in the guide's three main sections (\"Digital Camera Components,\" \"Standard Camera Functions,\" and \"How Do I?\"). Contents are labeled A to Z for quick reference. There's also a comprehensive table of contents and index so you'll waste no time flipping to the specific information you need--whether you want to transfer images, make a QuickTime movie, or just figure out what purpose that mystery setting on your camera serves. There's even a section of easy-to-read reference tables for quick look-up of white balance settings, exposure compensation, camera mode explanations, and plenty more.</p>", 3);

Because of this, kernel exploitation is becoming much more popular among exploit writers and attackers. Playing with the heart of the operating system can be a dangerous game: This book covers the theoretical techniques and approaches needed to develop reliable and effective kernel-level exploits and applies them to different operating systems (Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and Windows). Kernel exploits require both art and science to achieve. Every OS has its quirks and so every exploit must be molded to fully exploit its target. This book discusses the most popular OS families-UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, and Windows-and how to gain complete control over them. Concepts and tactics are presented categorically so that even when a specifically detailed exploit has been patched, the foundational information that you have read will help you to write a newer, better attack or a more concrete design and defensive structure.                                        \n\n   Covers a range of operating system families - UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, Windows   Details common scenarios such as generic memory corruption (stack overflow, heap overflow, etc.) issues, logical bugs and race conditions   Delivers the reader from user-land exploitation to the world of kernel-land (OS) exploits/attacks, with a particular focus on the steps that lead to the creation of successful techniques, in order to give to the reader something more than just a set of tricks", 3);

Among Cocoa's many attributes, its advanced object-oriented APIs allow you to develop in both Java and Objective-C. This revolutionary new way of developing sophisticated applications for the Macintosh is both powerful and easy.\n\nWith Learning Cocoa you'll become familiar with Cocoa application development, using Objective C, not merely by reading, but by doing.  The book begins with a discussion of essential object-oriented programming concepts for those with no previous experience. It proceeds through an introduction to the Cocoa environment, development, tools, and some simple tutorials to help you become familiar with the basic elements of Cocoa programming. The remaining tutorials guide you as you create a series of increasingly complex example applications. The techniques and concepts you learn in one tutorial lay the foundation for the more advanced techniques and concepts in the next.\n\nYou don't need extensive programming experience to complete the examples in this book, though it would be helpful to have some experience with the C programming language. The code for each example is included in the text so you can simply type it in. If you're already familiar with an object-oriented programming language like Java or Smalltalk, you'll quickly feel right at home with Objective-C, the language used throughout  this book.\n\nAs you ease your way into the experience of Cocoa programming, you're encouraged to play, to explore, to \"kick the tires.\" You'll finish this book much better prepared to take on serious application development with Cocoa, and you'll find Apple's development environment not only less mysterious, but one that you'll be eager to program in.\n\nWritten by insiders at Apple Computer, the book brings you information that you can't get anywhere else--and a potential leg up in the Mac OS X application development market.", 3);

The last complete Computer Science\ncurricular volume was released in 2001 (CC2001), and an interim review effort concluded in\n2008 (CS2008).\nThis volume, Computer Science Curricula 2013 (CS2013), represents a comprehensive revision.\nThe CS2013 guidelines include a redefined body of knowledge, a result of rethinking the\nessentials necessary for a Computer Science curriculum.  It also seeks to identify exemplars of\nactual courses and programs to provide concrete guidance on curricular structure and\ndevelopment in a variety of institutional contexts.\nThe development of curricular guidelines for Computer Science has always been challenging\ngiven the rapid evolution and expansion of the field. The growing diversity of topics potentially\nrelevant to an education in Computer Science and the increasing integration of computing with\nother disciplines create particular challenges for this effort.  Balancing topical growth with the\nneed to keep recommendations realistic and implementable in the context of undergraduate\neducation is particularly difficult.  As a result, the CS2013 Steering Committee made\nconsiderable effort to engage the broader computer science education community in a dialog to\nbetter understand new opportunities and local needs, and to identify successful models of\ncomputing curricula 鈥� whether established or novel.", 3);

These computing fields are related but\nalso quite different from each other. The variety of degree programs in computing presents students,\neducators, administrators, and other community leaders with choices about where to focus their efforts.\nSeveral questions naturally arise. What are these different kinds of computing degree programs? How\nare they similar? How do they differ? How can I tell what their names really mean? Which kinds of\nprograms should our local college or university offer?And so on. These are all valid questions, but to\nanyone unfamiliar with the breadth of computing, the responses to these queries may be difficult to\narticulate. This report may help to provide some answers.\nWe have created this report to explain the character of the various undergraduate degree programs in\ncomputing and to help you determine which of the programs are most suited to particular goals and\ncircumstances. We intend this report to serve a broad and varied audience. We think it can be helpful to:\n鈥� university faculty and administrators who are developing plans and curricula for computing-related\nprograms at their institutions, and to those who guide the accreditation of such programs, and\n鈥� responsible parties in public education, including boards of education, government officials, elected\nrepresentatives, and others who seek to represent the public interest.\nIn addition, we will soon be preparing The Guide to Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computing\n(henceforth the Guide). The Guidewill be an independent companion document that will be broadly\ndistributed to a more general audience. It is intended to serve:\n鈥� students who are trying to determine which path ofcomputing study fits their interests and goals,\n鈥� parents, teachers, guidance counselors, and others who are trying to assist students in their choices,\n鈥� professionals considering how to continue their education in a rapidly changing, dynamic field, and\n鈥� anyone who is trying to make sense of the wide range of undergraduate degree programs in computing\nthat are now available.", 3);

Unlike the old days, when designers cobbled together chunky HTML, bandwidth-hogging graphics, and a prayer to make their sites look good, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) now lets your inner designer come out and play. But CSS isn't just a tool to pretty up your site; it's a reliable method for handling all kinds of presentation-from fonts and colors to page layout. CSS: The Missing Manual clearly explains this powerful design language and how you can use it to build sparklingly new Web sites or refurbish old sites that are ready for an upgrade.\nLike their counterparts in print page-layout programs, style sheets allow designers to apply typographic styles, graphic enhancements, and precise layout instructions to elements on a Web page. Unfortunately, due to CSS's complexity and the many challenges of building pages that work in all Web browsers, most Web authors treat CSS as a kind of window-dressing to spruce up the appearance of their sites. Integrating CSS with a site's underlying HTML is hard work, and often frustratingly complicated. As a result many of the most powerful features of CSS are left untapped. With this book, beginners and Web-building veterans alike can learn how to navigate the ins-and-outs of CSS and take complete control over their Web pages' appearance.\nAuthor David McFarland (the bestselling author of O'Reilly's Dreamweaver: The Missing Manual) combines crystal-clear explanations, real-world examples, a dash of humor, and dozens of step-by-step tutorials to show you ways to design sites with CSS that work consistently across browsers. You'll learn how to:\nCreate HTML that's simpler, uses less code, is search-engine friendly, and works well with CSS\nStyle text by changing fonts, colors, font sizes, and adding borders\nTurn simple HTML links into complex and attractive navigation bars-complete with CSS-only rollover effects that add interactivity to your Web pages\nStyle images to create effective photo galleries and special effects like CSS-based drop shadows\nMake HTML forms look great without a lot of messy HTML\nOvercome the most hair-pulling browser bugs so your Web pages work consistently from browser to browser\nCreate complex layouts using CSS, including multi-column designs that don't require using old techniques like HTML tables\nStyle Web pages for printing\nUnlike competing books, this Missing Manual doesn't assume that everyone in the world only surfs the Web with Microsoft's Internet Explorer; our book provides support for all major Web browsers and is one of the first books to thoroughly document the newly expanded CSS support in IE7, currently in beta release.\nWant to learn how to turn humdrum Web sites into destinations that will capture viewers and keep them longer? Pick up CSS: The Missing Manual and learn the real magic of this tool.", 3);

Simply put, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a way to separate a document's structure from its presentation.

Now in this comprehensive book, power engineers and students can find the theoretical background necessary for understanding how to analyze, predict, and mitigate the two most severe power disturbances: voltage sags and interruptions. This is the first book to offer in--depth analysis of voltage sags and interruptions and to show how to apply mathematical techniques for practical solutions to these disturbances. From UNDERSTANDING AND SOLVING POWER QUALITY PROBLEMS you will gain important insights into * Various types of power quality phenomena and power quality standards* Current methods for power system reliability evaluation* Origins of voltage sags and interruptions* Essential analysis of voltage sags for characterization and prediction of equipment behavior and stochastic prediction* Mitigation methods against voltage sags and interruptions\" An Instructor Support FTP site is available from the Wiley editorial department: ftp://ftp.ieee.org/uploads/press/bollen Sponsored by: IEEE Power Electronics Society, IEEE Industry Applications Society, IEEE Power Engineering Society.", 3);

Units could be added or removed from buildings like  Kisho Kurokawa鈥檚 Capsule Tower in Toky  o  as required; buildings themselves could be added or removed from cities at will in the  cell-like master-plans of Fumihiko Maki .\n \n   Project Japan   features a series of vivid, empathetic conversations, replete with surprising connections and occasional clashes between  Koolhaas and Obrist  and their subjects. The story that unfolds is illuminated, contradicted and validated by commentaries from a broad range their forebearers, associates, critics, and progeny, including  Toyo Ito and Charles Jencks. \n \n Interspersed with the interviews and commentary are    hundreds of never-before-seen images : master-plans from Manchuria to Tokyo, intimate snapshots of the Metabolists at work and play, architectural models, magazine excerpts and astonishing sci-fi urban visions. Presented in a clear chronology from the  tabula rasa  of a colonized Manchuria in the 1930s; a devastated Japan after the war; to the establishment of  Metabolism  at the 1960 World Design Conference; to the rise of Kisho Kurokawa as the first celebrity architect; to the apotheosis of the movement at Expo '70 in Osaka. \n  \n Koolhaas and Obrist  unearth a history that casts new light on the key issues that both enervate and motivate architecture today: celebrity and seriousness, sustainability and monumentality, globalization, government participation (and abdication), and the necessity for architecture to reach beyond its traditional boundaries in order to embrace the future.", 3);

This book is Benjamin's effort to represent and to critique the bourgeois experience of 19th century history, and, in so doing, to liberate the suppressed \"true history\" that underlay the ideological mask. In the bustling, cluttered arcades, street and interior merge and historical time is broken up into kaleidoscopic distractions and displays of ephemera. Here, at a distance from what is normally meant by \"progress,\" Benjamin finds the lost time(s) embedded in the spaces of things.", 3);

In this challenging interpretation of design education and its effect on design process and products, Argentinean scholar Alfonso Corona-Martinez emphasizes the distinction between an architectural project, created in the architect's mind and materialized as a set of drawings on paper, and the realized three-dimensional building.Corona-Martinez demonstrates how representation plays a substantial role in determining both the notion and the character of architecture, and he traces this relationship from the Renaissance into the Modern era, giving detailed considerations of Functionalism and Typology. His argument clarifies the continuity in the practice of design method through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a continuity that has been obscured by the emphasis on changing goals instead of design procedures.Architectural schooling, he suggests, has had a decisive role in the transmission of these practices. He concludes that the methods formalized in Beaux Arts teaching are not only still with us but are in good part responsible for the stylistic instability that haunts Modern architecture.The Architectural Project presents subtle considerations that must be mastered if an architect is to properly use typology, the means of representation, and the elements of composition in architecture.

We were writing new software for use in the company鈥檚 high-volume call centers. Instead of the 12 months I told him we鈥檇 probably need, he had agreed to give me 4 months. We wouldn鈥檛 necessarily start using the new software in 4 months, but from that point on, all my boss could give me was 30 days鈥� notice of a go-live date. After the first 4 months, I would have to keep the software within 30 days of releasable. My boss understood that not all functionality would be there after 4 months. He just wanted as much as he could get, as fast as he could get it. I needed to find a process that would let us do this. I scoured everything I could find on software development processes, which led me to Scrum and to Ken Schwaber鈥檚 early writings on it.\nIn the years since my first Scrum project, I have used Scrum on commercial products, software for internal use, consulting projects, projects with ISO 9001 requirements, and others. Each of these projects was unique, but what they had in common was urgency and criticality. Scrum excels on urgent projects that are critical to an organization. Scrum excels when requirements are unknown, unknowable, or changing. Scrum excels by helping teams excel.\nIn this book, Ken Schwaber correctly points out that Scrum is hard. It鈥檚 not hard because of the things you do; it鈥檚 hard because of the things you don鈥檛 do. If you鈥檙e a project manager, you might find some of your conventional tools missing. There are no Gantt charts in Scrum, there鈥檚 no time reporting, and you don鈥檛 assign tasks to programmers. Instead you鈥檒l learn the few simple rules of Scrum and how to use its frequent inspect-and-adapt cycles to create more valuable software faster.\nKen was there at the beginning of Scrum. Ken, along with Jeff Sutherland, was the original creator of Scrum and has always been its most vocal proponent. In this book, we get to read about many of the Scrum projects Ken has participated in. Ken is a frequent and popular speaker at industry conferences, and if you鈥檝e ever heard him speak, you know he doesn鈥檛 pull any punches. This book is the same way: Ken presents both the successes and the failures of past Scrum projects. His goal is to teach us how to make our projects successful, and so he presents examples we can emulate and counterexamples for us to avoid.\nThis book clearly reflects Ken鈥檚 experience mentoring Scrum Teams and teaching Certified ScrumMaster courses around the world. Through the many stories in this book, Ken shares with us dozens of the lessons he鈥檚 learned. This book is an excellent guide for anyone looking to improve how he or she delivers software, and I recommend it highly.", 3);

Marsilio Ficino of Florence (1433-99) was one of the most influential thinkers of the Renaissance. He put before society a new ideal of human nature, emphasizing its divine potential. As teacher and guide to a remarkable circle of men, he made a vital contribution to changes that were taking place in European thought. For Ficino, the writings of Plato provided the key to the most important knowledge for mankind, knowledge of God and the soul. It was the absorption of this knowledge that proved so important to Ficino, to his circle, and to later writers and artists. As a young man, Ficino had been directed by Cosimo de' Medici towards the study of Plato in the original Greek. Later he formed a close connection with Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo de' Medici, under whom Florence achieved its age of brilliance. Gathered round Ficino and Lorenzo were such men as Landino, Bembo, Poliziano (with whom Ficino maintains a correspondence in this volume) and Pico della Mirandola. The ideas they discussed became central to the work of Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer, and many other writers and artists. This volume contains letters written in 1488 and 1489, with a preface added in the summer of 1490. There are also four important letters written in 1489 not included in the printed edition of his letters published in 1495, no doubt because they concern Ficino's \"Three Books on Life (De vita)\" and were published with it, together with a note to the reader printed there. These five items are appended to the present volume (Appendices A to E) as they help to complete the record of Ficino's engagement with other scholars at this period. In addition, some letters have been provided from his correspondents: Appendix F is Poliziano's reply to a request for help, G is a letter from Valori, and H is the covering letter Ficino wrote at the time he composed Book I of De vita. Appendix letters I to K are from Ermolao Barbaro, presenting the other side of the correspondence between him and Ficino. They date from 1484, 1488 and 1491 but are given together here. Appendix L presents another letter from Poliziano to Ficino, and M to Q are letters of dedication written by Filippo Valori for presentation copies of Ficino's work discussed in this volume.

Most of the dated letters are from June 1487 to October 1488, part of Florence's \"golden decade\", when Lorenzo de' Medici's astute politicking made him not only the peacemaker of the warring states of Italy, but also virtually controller of papal foreign policy. Ficino made good use of his time. Between 1482 and 1484 his major works were published: the \"Platonic Theology\", the \"Christian Religion\" and his translation from Greek into Latin of Plato's \"Dialogues\". He then turned to the translation of Plotinus. Important letters in this volume include his oration \"God is Love\", delivered to the clergy and people of Florence on the occasion of his installation as a canon of the cathedral in 1487. There are also letters comparing Moses with Plato and Socrates with Christ.", 3);

During his childhood Ficino was selected by Cosimo de' Medici for an education in the humanities. Later Cosimo directed him to learn Greek and then to translate all the works of Plato into Latin. This enormous task he completed in about five years. He then wrote two important books, \"The Platonic Theology\" and \"The Christian Religion\", showing how the Christian religion and Platonic philosophy were proclaiming the same message. The extraordinary influence the Platonic Academy came to exercise over the age arose from the fact that its leading spirits were already seeking fresh inspiration from the ideals of the civilizations of Greece and Rome and especially from the literary and philosophical sources of those ideals. Florence was the cultural and artistic centre of Europe at the time and leading men in so many fields were drawn to the Academy: Lorenzo de'Medici (Florence's ruler), Alberti (the architect) and Poliziano (the poet). Moreover Ficino bound together an enormous circle of correspondents throughout Europe, from the Pope in Rome to John Colet in London, from Reuchlin in Germany to de Ganay in France. Published during his lifetime, \"The Letters\" have not previously been translated into English. Following the Pazzi Conspiracy of 1478, Florence was at war with both the Pope (Sixtus IV) and King Ferdinand of Naples. Prompted by the appalling conditions under which Florence suffered as a result of the war, Ficino wrote eloquent letters to the three main protagonists. In his three letters to Sixtus, who was the main architect of the war, Ficino states in magnificent terms the true work of the Pope - to fish in the \"deep sea of humanity\", as did the Apostles. King Ferdinand of Naples spent most of his life in intrigue, not only against other states, but also against his own barons. Yet, Ficino addresses him in the words of his father, the admirable King Alfonso. This extraordinary letter, written in the form of a prophesy, speaks of his son's destiny on Earth. \"In peace alone a splendid victory awaits you..., in victory, tranquility; in tranquility, a reverence and worship of Minerva\" (wisdom). Negotiations for peace were in fact begun about five months later. In his letter to Lorenzo de 'Medici, Ficino presented, with dramatic clarity, the two sides of Lorenzo's nature. The letter may have prompted Lorenzo's bold visit to King Ferdinand's court and the ensuing negotiations for peace. In insisting on the reality of unity and peace in the face of war and division, Ficino uses a number of analogies. He speaks in at least two letters of all the colours emerging from simple white light, just as all the variety of the universe issues from one consciousness. \"For the Sun, to be is to shine, to shine is to see, and to illuminate is to create all that is its own and to sustain what it has created.\"", 3);

Some of the letters consist largely of passages taken from the dialogues, for example, those in praise of matrimony, medicine and philosophy. the largest single letter is a life of Plato which furnishes some interesting parallels with Ficino's own life, as described in a near contemporary biography by Giovanni Corsi which is included, partly for this reason, at the end of the volume. Corsi comments - \"The first thing which encouraged me to write about this man was that he himself not only investigated the precepts and mysteries (of the Platonic Academy) but also penetrated, laid open and expounded them to others. This was something which no one else for the previous thousand years so much as attempted, let alone accomplished.\"", 3);

This paperback edition includes far-reaching suggestions for research that could increase the impact that classroom teaching has on actual learning. Like the original hardcover edition, this book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to a number of compelling questions. When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do-with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods - to help children learn most effectively? New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb. \"How People Learn\" examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system. The topics include: how learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain; how existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn; what the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach; the amazing learning potential of infants; the relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace; learning needs and opportunities for teachers; and a realistic look at the role of technology in education.", 3);

Marsilio Ficino of Florence (1433-99) was one of the most influential thinkers of the Renaissance. He put before society a new ideal of human nature, emphasizing its divine potential. As teacher and guide to a remarkable circle of men, he made a vital contribution to changes that were taking place in European thought. For Ficino, the writings of Plato provided the key to the most important knowledge for mankind, knowledge of God and the soul. It was the absorption of this knowledge that proved so important to Ficino, to his circle, and to later writers and artists. As a young man, Ficino had been directed by Cosimo de' Medici towards the study of Plato in the original Greek. Later he formed a close connection with Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo de' Medici, under whom Florence achieved its age of brilliance. Gathered round Ficino and Lorenzo were such men as Landino, Bembo, Poliziano (with whom Ficino maintains a correspondence in this volume) and Pico della Mirandola. The ideas they discussed became central to the work of Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer, and many other writers and artists. This volume contains letters written in 1488 and 1489, with a preface added in the summer of 1490. There are also four important letters written in 1489 not included in the printed edition of his letters published in 1495, no doubt because they concern Ficino's \"Three Books on Life (De vita)\" and were published with it, together with a note to the reader printed there.

During his childhood Ficino was selected by Cosimo de' Medici for an education in the humanities. Later Cosimo directed him to learn Greek and then to translate all the works of Plato into Latin. This enormous task he completed in about five years. He then wrote two important books, \"The Platonic Theology\" and \"The Christian Religion\", showing how the Christian religion and Platonic philosophy were proclaiming the same message. The extraordinary influence the Platonic Academy came to exercise over the age arose from the fact that its leading spirits were already seeking fresh inspiration from the ideals of the civilizations of Greece and Rome and especially from the literary and philosophical sources of those ideals. Florence was the cultural and artistic centre of Europe at the time and leading men in so many fields were drawn to the Academy: Lorenzo de'Medici (Florence's ruler), Alberti (the architect) and Poliziano (the poet). Moreover Ficino bound together an enormous circle of correspondents throughout Europe, from the Pope in Rome to John Colet in London, from Reuchlin in Germany to de Ganay in France. Published during his lifetime, \"The Letters\" have not previously been translated into English. Following the Pazzi Conspiracy of 1478, Florence was at war with both the Pope (Sixtus IV) and King Ferdinand of Naples. Prompted by the appalling conditions under which Florence suffered as a result of the war, Ficino wrote eloquent letters to the three main protagonists. In his three letters to Sixtus, who was the main architect of the war, Ficino states in magnificent terms the true work of the Pope - to fish in the \"deep sea of humanity\", as did the Apostles. King Ferdinand of Naples spent most of his life in intrigue, not only against other states, but also against his own barons. Yet, Ficino addresses him in the words of his father, the admirable King Alfonso. This extraordinary letter, written in the form of a prophesy, speaks of his son's destiny on Earth. \"In peace alone a splendid victory awaits you..., in victory, tranquility; in tranquility, a reverence and worship of Minerva\" (wisdom). Negotiations for peace were in fact begun about five months later. In his letter to Lorenzo de 'Medici, Ficino presented, with dramatic clarity, the two sides of Lorenzo's nature. The letter may have prompted Lorenzo's bold visit to King Ferdinand's court and the ensuing negotiations for peace. In insisting on the reality of unity and peace in the face of war and division, Ficino uses a number of analogies. He speaks in at least two letters of all the colours emerging from simple white light, just as all the variety of the universe issues from one consciousness. \"For the Sun, to be is to shine, to shine is to see, and to illuminate is to create all that is its own and to sustain what it has created.\"", 3);

Published during his lifetime, \"The Letters\" have not previously been translated into English. This third volume consists of the 39 letters Ficino published in his book IV, which he dedicated to Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary. During the period covered by the letters in this volume, Ficino was working on a revision of his translations of Plato's dialogues and his commentaries on them. Some of the letters consist largely of passages taken from the dialogues, for example, those in praise of matrimony, medicine and philosophy. the largest single letter is a life of Plato which furnishes some interesting parallels with Ficino's own life, as described in a near contemporary biography by Giovanni Corsi which is included, partly for this reason, at the end of the volume. Corsi comments - \"The first thing which encouraged me to write about this man was that he himself not only investigated the precepts and mysteries (of the Platonic Academy) but also penetrated, laid open and expounded them to others. This was something which no one else for the previous thousand years so much as attempted, let alone accomplished.\"", 3);

For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications.\nThis completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.\nThe book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics.

Theory that establishes the conceptual framework for learning is included, and so are heuristics that impact the performance of real learning systems. ---- Learning from data is a very dynamic field. Some of the hot techniques and theories at times become just fads, and others gain traction and become part of the field.

This approach is sure to appeal to programmers and system administrators who have urgent problems and a preference for learning by semi-guided experimentation.\nFirst off, Learning Python shows the relationships among Python scripts and their interpreter (in a mostly platform-neutral way). Then, the authors address the mechanics of the language itself, providing illustrations of how Python conceives of numbers, strings, and other objects as well as the operators you use to work with them. Dictionaries, lists, tuples, and other data structures specific to Python receive plenty of attention including complete examples.\nAuthors Mark Lutz and David Ascher build on that fundamental information in their discussions of functions and modules, which evolve into coverage of namespaces, classes, and the object-oriented aspects of Python programming. There's also information on creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Python applications with Tkinter.\nIn addition to its careful expository prose, Learning Python includes exercises that both test your Python skills and help reveal more elusive truths about the language. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\nReview\nAs a book for programmers who want to learn Python, it does a very good job.

You arrive without departing. Master Sheng-yen provides an unprecedented understanding of Chan, its precepts, and its practice. Beginning with a basic overview of Buddhism and meditation, 'Hoofprint of the Ox' detials the progressive mental exercises traditionally followed by all Buddhists. Known as the Three Disciplines, these procedures develop moral purity, meditiative concentration, and enlightening insight through the 'stilling' of the mind. Master Sheng-yen then expounds Chan Buddhism, recounting its centuries-old history in China and illuminating its fundamental tenets. He contemplates the nature of Buddhahood, specifies the physical and mental prerequisites for beginning Chan practice, and humbly considers what it means to be an enlightened Chan master. Drawing its title from a famous series of pictures that symbolizes the Chan path as the search of an ox-herd for his wayward ox, 'Hoofprint of the Ox' is an inspirational guide to self-discovery through mental transformation.

This cumbersome process inevitably created errors and made it increasingly difficult to identify the original readings among multiple copies. Lachmann's method - associated with German classicist Karl Lachmann (1793-1851) - aimed to provide scholars with a scientific, systematic procedure to standardize the transmission of ancient texts. Although these guidelines for analysis were frequently challenged, they retained a paradigmatic value in philology for many years. In 1963, Italian philologist Sebastiano Timpanaro became the first to analyze in depth the history and limits of Lachmann's widely established theory with his publication, \"La genesi del metodo del Lachmann\". This important work, which brought Timpanaro international repute, now appears in its first English translation. \"The Genesis of Lachmann's Method\" examines the origin, development, and validity of Lachmann's model as well as its association with Lachmann himself. It remains a fundamental work on the history and methods of philology, and Glenn W. Most's translation makes this seminal study available to an English-speaking audience. Revealing Timpanaro's extraordinary talent as a textual critic and world-class scholar, this book will be indispensable to classicists, textual critics, biblical scholars, historians of science, and literary theorists.", 3);

In addition to the new content, the volumes have been reorganized both within and between volumes to reflect the most up-to-date scholarship on the order in which the plays were originally written. The result is a set of handsome paperbacks destined to introduce new generations of readers to these foundational works of Western drama, art, and life.", 3);

The Catalogue of Women is a systematic presentation in five books of a large number of Greek legendary heroes and episodes, organized according to the genealogy of the heroes鈥� mortal mothers. The Shield provides a Hesiodic counterpoint to the shield of Achilles in the Iliad, with Heracles as the protagonist. The volume concludes with a comprehensive index to the complete edition.", 3);
